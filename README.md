### A modified version of PlayCover, including experimental bugfixes and features.
<span style="color: gray">It is recommended to use the official build in most cases, as the modified version may be unstable.</span>

### How to Use

1. Download the latest release from [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/viatearz/PlayCover/actions/workflows/unsigned_release.yml).
2. Install the app.
3. Self-sign and trust the app by running:
    ``` bash
    codesign -fs- /Applications/PlayCover.app/Contents/Frameworks/PlayTools.framework/PlugIns/AKInterface.bundle
    codesign -fs- /Applications/PlayCover.app/Contents/Frameworks/PlayTools.framework
    xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/PlayCover.app
    ```

### Note

For iOS apps that were already installed using the official build, you may need to perform the following steps:
1.	Right-click the app icon, select `Settings`, and click `Reset Settings` at the bottom. This will restore the recommended configuration.
2.	Reinstall the app, as some tweaks are only applied during installation.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Welcome to PlayCover! This software is all about allowing you to run iOS apps and games on Apple Silicon devices running macOS 12.0 or newer.

PlayCover works by putting applications through a wrapper which imitates an iPad. This allows the apps to run natively and perform very well.

PlayCover also allows you to map custom touch controls to keyboard, which is not possible in alternative sideloading methods such as Sideloadly. 

These controls include all the essentials, from WASD, camera movement, left and right clicks, and individual keymapping, similar to a popular Android emulator’s keymapping system called Bluestacks.

This software was originally designed to run Genshin Impact on your Apple Silicon device, but it can now run a wide range of applications. Unfortunately, not all games are supported, and some may have bugs.

Localisations handled in [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/playcover/).

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to get Genshin Impact, and many other games, up and running in no time.

### Prerequisites

At the moment, PlayCover can only run on Apple Silicon Macs. This means that only devices with M-series SoCs (eg. M1) are supported.

If you have an Intel Mac, you can explore alternatives like Bootcamp or emulators.

### Download

You can download stable releases [here](https://github.com/PlayCover/PlayCover/releases), or build from source by following the instructions in the Documentation.

### Documentation

To learn how to setup and use PlayCover, visit the documentation [here](https://playcover.github.io/PlayBook).

### Homebrew Cask
We host a [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) tap with the [PlayCover cask](https://github.com/PlayCover/homebrew-playcover/blob/master/Casks/playcover-community.rb). To install from it run:

```sh
brew install --cask PlayCover/playcover/playcover-community
```

To uninstall:
1. Remove PlayCover using `brew uninstall --cask playcover-community`;
2. Untap `PlayCover/playcover` with `brew untap PlayCover/playcover`.
